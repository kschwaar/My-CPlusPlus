Week 13:

1. Create a 5 second audio clip in Audacity.
2. Pick any 5 second video you have posted and add the sound.

Essential Notes for this-

How to add sound
Workflow;
1. Create your sound clips in Audacity. Use a decent lossless codec like ogg or flac.

2. Soundclip should be the same duration as the video (concatinate in Audacity).

3. The command in ffmpeg example:

ffmpeg -r 25 -i video.mpg-r 25 -i audio.flac -sameq scene01.mpg

so the sample rate for audio is based on the base? Look this up.

4. If you prefer making one scene at a time, you can concatenate scenes this way in linux:

Use linux concat to put movie clips together.. file1 file2 > file3

cat scene01.dvd scene02.dvd scene03.dvd > combined.dvd
