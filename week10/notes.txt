//Overloading Operators
//In Java, suppose we want to add two ratios:
//Member function: Ratio add(Ratio r){};
//Static function: public static Ratio add (Ratio a, Ratio b){};

//A and B might be matrices.  We don't want to call methods, just want to A+B;

C++ has a huge number of operators.  SEE TEXT BOOK!!!  (the one day that I don't bring the book to class....)
You can overload virtually all of them.

ex. 
-> member selecction operators
[] subscript operators
() function call
++ increment
-- decrement
~ bitwise complement
! logical not
+,-,*,/,%
==, <, etc.
AND MANY MORE!!!  ...damn.




FINAL PROJECT!!!  Use lists to build a program capable of doing polynomial arithmetic.
